version: 0.0.1 # profile link file version

about:
  description:
    This file defines the social profile links which are related to
    me, thus enabling users to locate me through social media. The
    file is generalized with different `arguments` and/or `keywords`
    which can be used for different programming purposes.

  usage:
    # TODO How to use the content to automatically update?
    # ! Can setup a CI/CD pipeline to check if the contents are
    # ! changed, and then run a script to update logics/links.
    Use the links provided to populate different types of files (like
    README.md, contact.htnl etc.) and once this file is edited other
    links should be automatically changed/updated. Directly access
    the file using "raw github user content" using the following -
    ```python
      import json
      import yaml
      import urllib

      response = urllib.request.urlopen("<raw-file-link>")
      meta = yaml.load(response, Loader = yaml.FullLoader)
      print(json.dumps(meta, indent = 2))
    ```
